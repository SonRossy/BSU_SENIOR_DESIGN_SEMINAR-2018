# BSU_SENIOR_DESIGN_SEMINAR-2018
Objective: Fix issues on a large gitub project
Your group needs to go on github and find a project with _50+ files and 3000+_ lines of existing code that is something the group would be interested in sinking the last 6 weeks of the semester into fixing/extending. Propose it in the group private channels that I have created and invited you to. These projects should have some open issues. We'll look at the issues, which are usually a selection of feature enhancements and bugs and select a few for the group to work on for the remainder of the semester.
